## Setup and Installation

### Dependencies

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries: torch, transformers, opencv-python, sqlite3, PIL, etc.
- Additional dependencies as per individual helper module requirements.

### Installation Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `dataprepping_generative_ai` directory.
3. Install required Python libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Download and place necessary model files in the `Images/labelling/models/` directory.

## Usage

### Running the Main Script

`main.py` in the `labelling` directory coordinates the processing of images and videos. It uses helper functions from `annotation_helpers/` for specific annotations. Annotation results are stored in an SQLite database via `db_utils.py`.

### Database Utilities

`db_utils.py` handles all database operations, including table creation, data insertion, and batch processing.

### Annotation Helpers

Each helper module in `annotation_helpers/` specializes in a specific type of annotation. Modules can be activated individually in `main.py`.

## Key Features

- Face Detection (`face_detection.py`): Implements face detection using OpenFace or InsightFace. Detected faces and landmarks are written to the SQLite database.
- Description Generation (`description.py`): Generates detailed image descriptions using the BLIP model.
- Video Processing (`Videos/checkvalid.py`): Functions to validate and process video files, extracting frames and annotations.
